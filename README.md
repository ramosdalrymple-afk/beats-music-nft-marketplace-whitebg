Why Beats?

NFTs has brought an exciting era to the crypto world. 
2021 is the year when NFTs became the mainstream. 
It has federated the world of art and crypto. 
But to make it even more exciting, we are not just 
sticking to the traditional NFT art fairs.  We all know 
that music has the power to connect people. Our NFT 
is a unique way for people to create connections not 
only between fans and musicians, but also to attract 
community that are willing to support artists, 
musicians and gamers. It is an innovative experience 
where artists can showcase their unique creations 
and fans to enjoy and get the assets that are worth 
the value. Both users are able to access the more 
exciting ways to maximize their digital earnings like 
Beats, play-to-earn games and earning from 
listening to music. 

Marketplace

Beats Marketplace is the heart of the Beats' 
project. It is created to support the project 
perfectly. Designed to open doors to different 
creators everywhere and to be the main 
platform where they can auction their own 
creations or arts. The team has worked 
entirely to develop its own token which will 
generate higher demand for the market - 
the $SOUL Token. Every art is purchased 
using the $SOUL Token. With all these 
amazing features, it is one step away from a 
great and bigger community of Beats 
Marketplace users.

$SOUL Token

$SOUL Token will be used to create, power 
and sustain the Beats ecosystem.
To this end the team has created a 
tokenomics model that ensures enough 
token liquidity at each stage of project 
development as well as healthy token 
release rate compensated by a built-in 
token burn mechanism.

Currency:

$SOUL Token will serve as the basic currency 
for Beats Marketplace. 
Premium Services
$SOUL Token will be the ticket to accessing a 
range of other In-app and cloud services as 
development continues. Will also be used in 
purchasing Merch, event ticket, auctions and 
more!
